Imagine you are working with two robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping. The robots' mission is to collaborate and complete tasks based on a given instructions. However, they may struggle with high-level instructions
Your role is to understand those instructions and break them down into smaller, actionable sub-tasks. You will also assign the tasks to specific robot and order the tasks. If there is ambiguity in deciding the object given existing information, just list all possible objects like Example 1.
If one robot needs to wait for the other to finish a particular sub-task, assign them task "wait" at the same line. 
Here are some examples:

Object state: fridge(closed), green apple(on table), red apple(on table)
Robot capacity: robot_a=['mobile base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mobile base', 'gripper']
Instruction: put the apple in the fridge.
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a" : "Open the fridge.", "robot_b" : "Pick up apple_x." },
  "2": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b" : "Put apple_x into the fridge.",},
  "3": {"robot_a": "Close the fridge.", "robot_b" : "Wait",},
}

Object state: cabinet(closed)
Robot capacity: robot_a=[], robot_b=[]
Instruction: open the top white cabinet
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a": "Open the cabinet.", "robot_b": "Wait"}
}

Object state: N/A
Robot capacity: robot_a=['fixed base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mobile base', 'gripper']
Instruction: put the spoon into the bottom black shelf
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a" : "Open the bottom black shelf.", "robot_b" : "Go to the spoon"},
  "2": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b" : "Pick up the spoon." },
  "3": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b": "Go to robot_a"},
  "4": {"robot_a" : "Take spoon", "robot_b" : "Give spoon to robot_a"},
  "5": {"robot_a" : "Put spoon into the bottom black shelf", "robot_b": "Wait"}
  "6": {"robot_a" : "Close the bottom black shelf.", "robot_b" : "Wait"}
}

Rules:
1. In each sub-task of your response, the robot should manipulate one object and only move its gripper once.
2. If you think the instruction is low-level enough, just repeat the instruction in your response
3. Omit assumptions and only follow a json format after the word Response:
4. All items should be put inside the box.
5. Mounted robot cannot move around but can place objects in the box.
6. No need to open or close the box as it is not lidded.
7. mounted robot_a is more efficient in gathering items from the table.
8. robot_a needs to put down the box before it picks up other things.
9. The apple should be left on the table.
10. robot_a should be careful to differentiate between items that should be picked up and those that should be left.
11. robot_a is a mounted robot and cannot move around.

Object state: Object State: table(mounted robot_b), box(on table), stapler(on table), pen(on table), apple(on table), robot_a(at table), robot_b(mounted on table)
Robot Capacity: robot_a=['mobile base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mounted base', 'gripper']
{'1': {'robot_a': 'Pick up the box.', 'robot_b': 'Pick up the stapler.'}, '2': {'robot_a': 'Place the box down.', 'robot_b': 'Put the stapler into the box.'}, '3': {'robot_a': 'Open the box.', 'robot_b': 'Pick up the pen.'}, '4': {'robot_a': 'Wait', 'robot_b': 'Put the pen into the box.'}, '5': {'robot_a': 'Close the box.', 'robot_b': 'Leave the apple on the table.'}}
robot_a is performing the task: pick up the box.
All robots are busy on their tasks.

*at save_info*
A robot is doing a task, and a human is giving it feedback to help it complete the task correctly. 
Your first task is to use the command 'save_information(info_name, info_value, response_round: int)' to store the correct value of "task-related knowledge".
Your second task is to determine whether there are additional waypoints needed. To do this, you need to distinguish between positional adjustments and waypoints based on analyzing human's feedback.

Below are some examples:

Imagine you are working with two robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping. The robots' mission is to collaborate and complete tasks based on a given instructions. However, they may struggle with high-level instructions
Your role is to understand those instructions and break them down into smaller, actionable sub-tasks. You will also assign the tasks to specific robot and order the tasks. If there is ambiguity in deciding the object given existing information, just list all possible objects like Example 1.
If one robot needs to wait for the other to finish a particular sub-task, assign them task "wait" at the same line. 
Here are some examples:

Object state: fridge(closed), green apple(on table), red apple(on table)
Robot capacity: robot_a=['mobile base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mobile base', 'gripper']
Instruction: put the apple in the fridge.
Response:

Response:

  "2": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b" : "Pick up the spoon." },

}

Rules:
1. In each sub-task of your response, the robot should manipulate one object and only move its gripper once.
2. If you think the instruction is low-level enough, just repeat the instruction in your response
3. Omit assumptions and only follow a json format after the word Response:
4. All items should be put inside the box.
5. Mounted robot cannot move around but can place objects in the box.
6. No need to open or close the box as it is not lidded.
7. mounted robot_a is more efficient in gathering items from the table.
8. robot_a needs to put down the box before it picks up other things.
9. The apple should be left on the table.
10. robot_a should be careful to differentiate between items that should be picked up and those that should be left.
11. robot_a is a mounted robot and cannot move around.
12. The box is open and doesn't need to be opened again.
13. The task is to clean up the table, and likely means to clear all objects from it.

A robot is doing a task, and a human is giving it feedback to help it complete the task correctly. 
Your first task is to use the command 'save_information(info_name, info_value, response_round: int)' to store the correct value of "task-related knowledge".
Your second task is to determine whether there are additional waypoints needed. To do this, you need to distinguish between positional adjustments and waypoints based on analyzing human's feedback.
