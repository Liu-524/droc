Imagine you are working with two robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping. The robots' mission is to collaborate and complete tasks based on a given instructions. However, they may struggle with high-level instructions
Your role is to understand those instructions and break them down into smaller, actionable sub-tasks. You will also assign the tasks to specific robot and order the tasks. If there is ambiguity in deciding the object given existing information, just list all possible objects like Example 1.
If one robot needs to wait for the other to finish a particular sub-task, assign them task "wait" at the same line. 
Here are some examples:

Object state: fridge(closed), green apple(on table), red apple(on table)
Robot capacity: robot_a=['mobile base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mobile base', 'gripper']
Instruction: put the apple in the fridge.
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a" : "Open the fridge.", "robot_b" : "Pick up apple_x." },
  "2": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b" : "Put apple_x into the fridge.",},
  "3": {"robot_a": "Close the fridge.", "robot_b" : "Wait",},
}

Object state: cabinet(closed)
Robot capacity: robot_a=[], robot_b=[]
Instruction: open the top white cabinet
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a": "Open the cabinet.", "robot_b": "Wait"}
}

Object state: N/A
Robot capacity: robot_a=['fixed base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mobile base', 'gripper']
Instruction: put the spoon into the bottom black shelf
Response:
{
  "1": {"robot_a" : "Open the bottom black shelf.", "robot_b" : "Go to the spoon"},
  "2": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b" : "Pick up the spoon." },
  "3": {"robot_a" : "Wait", "robot_b": "Go to robot_a"},
  "4": {"robot_a" : "Take spoon", "robot_b" : "Give spoon to robot_a"},
  "5": {"robot_a" : "Put spoon into the bottom black shelf", "robot_b": "Wait"}
  "6": {"robot_a" : "Close the bottom black shelf.", "robot_b" : "Wait"}
}

Rules:
1. In each sub-task of your response, the robot should manipulate one object and only move its gripper once.
2. If you think the instruction is low-level enough, just repeat the instruction in your response
3. Omit assumptions and only follow a json format after the word Response:
4. The apple needs to be stable for the knife to cut it which implies the apple needing to be on a table or solid surface.
5. robot_a can not move away from the table; robot_b only has one gripper and can not hold two items (knife and apple) at the same time.
6. robot_b should not pick up the apple.
7. Robot_b can only hold one item at a time.
8. All tasks happening on the table should be done by robot_a as it is mounted on the table.
9. robot_b cannot perform tasks on table as robot_a is mounted there.
10. Cutting board should be put on the table before putting the apple.
11. robot_a cannot place the apple without the board being placed on the table.

Object state: Object State: table(mounted robot_b), orange(on table), knife(in sink), cutting_board(in sink), robot_a(at table), robot_b(mounted on table)
Robot Capacity: robot_a=['mobile base', 'gripper'], robot_b=['mounted base', 'gripper']

{'1': {'robot_a': 'Go to the sink.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '2': {'robot_a': 'Pick up cutting_board.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '3': {'robot_a': 'Go to table.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '4': {'robot_a': 'Place cutting_board on table.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '5': {'robot_a': 'Go to sink.', 'robot_b': 'Place orange on cutting_board.'}, '6': {'robot_a': 'Pick up knife.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '7': {'robot_a': 'Go to table.', 'robot_b': 'Wait'}, '8': {'robot_a': 'Give knife to robot_b.', 'robot_b': 'Take knife from robot_a'}, '9': {'robot_a': 'Wait', 'robot_b': 'Cut the orange.'}}

*at save_info*
A robot is doing a task, and a human is giving it feedback to help it complete the task correctly. 
Your first task is to use the command 'save_information(info_name, info_value, response_round: int)' to store the correct value of "task-related knowledge".
Your second task is to determine whether there are additional waypoints needed. To do this, you need to distinguish between positional adjustments and waypoints based on analyzing human's feedback.

A robot is doing a task, and a human is giving it feedback to help it complete the task correctly. 
Your first task is to use the command 'save_information(info_name, info_value, response_round: int)' to store the correct value of "task-related knowledge".
Your second task is to determine whether there are additional waypoints needed. To do this, you need to distinguish between positional adjustments and waypoints based on analyzing human's feedback.
