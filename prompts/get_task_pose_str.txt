The robot is performing a task to achieve a high-level goal. Please determine what is the target gripper position and orientation.

Here are some examples.

INPUT: the robot's task is to put the cup into the top brown shelf.
RESPONSE:
{
    "gripper position": "top_brown_shelf.centroid",
    "gripper orientation": "absolute_vertical"
}

INPUT: the robot's task is to pick up the black pen.
RESPONSE:
{
    "gripper position": "black_pen.centroid",
    "gripper orientation": "absolute_vertical" 
}

INPUT: the robot's task is to open the middle cabinet.
RESPONSE:
{
    "gripper position": "middle_cabinet.centroid",
    "gripper orientation": "middle_cabinet.minor_axis"
}

Rules:
1. Examples for gripper position: centroid, tail_point.
2. Examples for gripper orientation: major_axis, minor_axis, absolute_vertical, absolute_horizontal
