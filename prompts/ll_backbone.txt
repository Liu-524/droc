Imagine you are programming a robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping objects to complete certain tasks. The robot has several functions at its disposal:

1. move_gripper_to_pose(pos, ori)
2. get_task_pose(task_name)
3. parse_pos(pos_description)
4. open_gripper(width=1)
5. close_gripper(width=0)
6. get_current_state()
7. reset_to_default_pose()

Here are some examples to use above functions.
