# Prompt Overview

## Plan-level (High-level)
1. **hl_backbone.txt**: Prompt backbone for generating high-level plans. Please refer to `utils/modulable_prompt.py` for details. 
2. **hl_cap_backbone.txt**: Prompt backbone for generating high-level plans for the Code-as-Policy baseline.
3. **hl_cap_content.txt**: Prompt content for generating high-level plans for the Code-as-Policy baseline.
4. **hl_content.txt**: Prompt content for generating high-level plans.
5. **hl_corr.txt**: Interpret high-level corrections.
6. **hl_retrieval.txt**: Retireve high-level knowledge from the knowledge base based on semantics similarity.
7. **get_constraint_feature.txt**: Determine which previous tasks interact with the same object with the current task.


## Skill-level (Low-level)
1. **ll_backbone.txt**: Prompt backbone for generating low-level skills.
2. **ll_content.txt**: Prompt content for generating low-level skills.
3. **ll_corr_nohist.txt**: Interpret low-level corrections for the no-history baseline.
4. **ll_corr.txt**: Interpret low-level corrections.
5. **ll_distill.txt**: Distill low-level knowledge from the interaction history.
6. **ll_retrieval.txt**: Retrieve low-level knowledge from the knowledge base.
7. **get_task_feature.txt**: Get the task-related knowledge type for a given task.
8. **hist_retrieval.txt**: Retrieve related interaction history to interpret a correction.


## Functional
1. **change_frame.txt**: Determine whether current reference frame need to be changed based on the corrections.
2. **get_ini_obj_state.txt**: Ask LLM to infer the initial state of the objetcs.
3. **update_obj_state.txt**: Update the objects' states after a skill is finished.
4. **get_pos_scale.txt**: Get the scale for vague distance expressions (e.g., “a little bit”) in the correction.
5. **get_pose_from_str.py**: Get the reference frame (pose) given an object query.
6. **get_task_pose_str.txt**: Determine the grasp pose for grasping a given object represented by the geometric properties of the object.
7. **is_planning_error.txt**: Determine whether the error is plan-level (high-level) or skill-level given the correction.


## Parsing
1. **parse_name.txt**: Parse the open-world object names generated by LLMs to the object names defined in CLIP candidates.
2. **parse_ori.py**: Parse a text description of orientation to a numpy array.
3. **parse_plan.txt**: Parse the textual plan to a given format.
4. **parse_pos.py**: Parse a text description of position to a numpy array.
5. **replace_des_with_val.txt**: Replace the text description of positions in the interaction history with values. 
6. **replace_true_name.txt**: Replace the vague reference in the object name with the object's true name.
7. **get_obj_name_from_task.txt**: Extract the object's name from a sentence description of the task.
8. **get_query_obj.txt**: Extract the visual feature description from the full object name.
