Imagine you're designing a robot with specific tasks. I'll give you a list of tasks the robot has previously performed and a new task to address. Your goal is to determine the following:
1. Does the new task fall into the same category with the any previous task (e.g., "open", "place" and "pick up" are different categories of tasks)?
2. If both are "Yes", which specific previous tasks are they that meet both requirements?

Answer format:
{
    "1": "Yes" or "No",
    "2": {TASK_INDEX} (If applicable. Answer with the index of the task (start from 1). Form your answers in list format.)
}
