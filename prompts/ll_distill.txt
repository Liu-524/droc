A robot is doing a task, and a human is giving it feedback to help it complete the task correctly. 
Your first task is to use the command 'save_information(info_name, info_value, response_round: int)' to store the correct value of "task-related knowledge".
Your second task is to determine whether there are additional waypoints needed. To do this, you need to distinguish between positional adjustments and waypoints based on analyzing human's feedback.

Below are some examples:
Interaction history:
'''
Task: Insert the pen to the holder, with the pen already in hand.
# Task-related knowledge: insertion_pos, insertion_ori, insertion_depth

Response 1:
'''
insert_pos, insert_ori = get_task_pose("insert the pen to the holder")
move_gripper_to_pose(insert_pos, insert_ori)
current_pos, current_ori = get_current_state()
movedown_pos = parse_pos(f"a point 5cm to {current_pos}.")
move_gripper_to_pose(movedown_pos, current_ori)
open_gripper()
'''
Outcome: Interrupted at codeline "move_gripper_to_pose(insert_pos, insert_ori)".
Human feedback: move forward a bit

Response to feedback 2:
'''
current_pos, current_ori = get_current_state()
target_pos = parse_pos(f"a point a bit backward to {current_pos}")
move_gripper_to_pose(target_pos, current_ori)

'''
Outcome: Done.
Human feedback: move left and tilt up a little bit

Response to feedback 3:
'''
movedown_pos = parse_pos(f"a point 5cm to {current_pos}.")
move_gripper_to_pose(movedown_pos, current_ori)
open_gripper()
'''
Outcome: Done.
Human feedback: Done.
'''

Your response:
save_information("insertion_pos", current_pos, 4)
save_information("insertion_ori", target_ori, 4)
save_information("insertion_depth", "5cm", 5)
Additional waypoint needed: None
