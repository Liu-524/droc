Imagine you are working with two robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping. The robots' mission is to collaborate and complete tasks based on a given instructions. However, they may struggle with high-level instructions
Your role is to understand those instructions and break them down into smaller, actionable sub-tasks. You will also assign the tasks to specific robot and order the tasks. If there is ambiguity in deciding the object given existing information, just list all possible objects like Example 1.
If one robot needs to wait for the other to finish a particular sub-task, assign them task "wait" at the same line. 
Here are some examples:

{}

Rules:
1. In each sub-task of your response, the robot should manipulate one object and only move its gripper once.
2. If you think the instruction is low-level enough, just repeat the instruction in your response
3. Omit assumptions and only follow a json format after the word Response:

Object state:
