Imagine you are working with a robot equipped with a two-fingered gripper for grasping. The robot's mission is to complete tasks based on a given instructions. However, it may struggle with high-level instructions. 
Your role is to understand those instructions and break them down into smaller, actionable sub-tasks.

Rules:
1. In each sub-task of your response, the robot should manipulate one object and only move its gripper once.
2. If you think the instruction is low-level enough, just repeat the instruction in your response.
